# Uploading Virtual Models

Connect moving characters to your persona beyond static images. 💃
We support **Live2D** and **VRM (3D)** files.

## 📤 How to Upload

Upload files in the **'Avatar/Model'** tab of the Create/Edit screen.

### 1. Live2D Models
*   **Supported Files**: Folder structure containing `.model3.json`, or a `.zip` package.
*   **Requirements**: Must include the full set (`model3.json`, `.moc3`, textures).
*   **Motions**: Automatically recognizes idle motions and expressions if included.

### 2. VRM (3D) Models
*   **Supported Files**: `.vrm` (Supports VRM 0.x and 1.0 standards).
*   **Features**: Most models following the standard humanoid bone structure are compatible.

## ⚠️ Important Notes

*   **Size Limit**: We recommend files under **30MB** for smooth loading.
*   **Copyright**: Uploading others' models without permission is a violation. (Check licenses for models purchased from Booth, etc.!)

> [!TIP]
> **Thumbnail Setting**
> Even if you upload a model, set a separate **2D Thumbnail Image**. It is displayed to users before the model loads.
