## Expert Mode Guide

Use Expert Mode if you want to create a more sophisticated character.

*   **System Prompt**: You can directly write the AI's behavioral guidelines. Use `{{user}}`, `{{char}}` variables to create dynamic situations.
*   **Example Dialogue**: Entering 3 or more examples of how the character speaks makes the tone much more natural.
*   **Knowledge Base (RAG)**: If you upload world settings or long documents the character needs to know, it will reference them during conversation.
