`,At=`# 기본 제작 가이드 (Basic Mode)

복잡한 설정 없이, 누구나 쉽고 빠르게 페르소나를 만들 수 있는 모드입니다.
**단 4단계**만 거치면 나만의 AI 친구가 탄생합니다! 🥚 ➡️ 🐣

## 🛠️ 제작 단계

### 1. 기본 정보 (Identity)
*   **이름**: 캐릭터의 이름을 지어주세요.
*   **프로필 이미지**: 캐릭터를 가장 잘 표현하는 이미지를 업로드하세요.
    *   (팁) 얼굴이 잘 보이는 이미지가 클릭률이 높습니다.
*   **카테고리**: 판타지, 로맨스, 학교 등 장르를 선택합니다.

### 2. 페르소나 설정 (Persona)
캐릭터의 성격을 결정하는 가장 중요한 단계입니다.
*   **성격 태그**: \`츤데레\` \`다정함\` \`냉철함\` 등 키워드를 선택하면 AI가 자동으로 성격을 형성합니다.
*   **소개글**: 캐릭터 목록에 표시될 짧은 문구입니다. (예: "너의 소꿉친구, 하지만 비밀이 있어.")

### 3. 첫인사 (First Message)
유저가 채팅방에 처음 들어왔을 때, 캐릭터가 건넬 첫 마디입니다.
*   상황을 묘사하거나(행동 지문), 말을 거는 형태로 작성해보세요.
*   *예시: "(책을 읽다가 고개를 들며) 어, 왔어? 기다리고 있었어."*

### 4. 공개 설정
*   **공개(Public)**: 누구나 검색하고 대화할 수 있습니다. (인센티브 대상)
*   **비공개(Private)**: 나만 대화할 수 있습니다. 테스트용으로 추천합니다.

디테일, 그 이상의 완벽함. 🛠️
프롬프트 엔지니어링을 통해 캐릭터의 영혼까지 설계하고 싶은 분들을 위한 고급 도구입니다.

## 🏗️ 주요 기능

### 1. 시스템 프롬프트 (System Prompt)
AI의 행동 원칙을 직접 제어합니다.
*   \`{{user}}\`, \`{{char}}\` 변수를 사용하여 동적으로 이름이 바뀌도록 설정할 수 있습니다.
*   마크다운(Markdown) 문법을 사용하여 가독성 있게 지침을 내릴 수 있습니다.

### 2. 대화 예시 (Few-shot Examples)
"백문이 불여일견." AI에게 말투를 학습시키는 가장 확실한 방법입니다.
*   \`<START>\` 태그로 구분하여 여러 개의 대화 예시를 입력하세요.
*   캐릭터 특유의 말투, 감탄사, 행동 지문을 포함하면 완벽하게 모방합니다.

### 3. 지식 베이스 (KB / RAG)
캐릭터가 알아야 할 방대한 설정이나 세계관 문서를 업로드하세요.
*   캐릭터가 대화 중에 해당 정보를 "검색"하여 답변에 반영합니다.
*   *예: 판타지 소설의 마법 설정집, 역사적 사건 연표 등*

### 4. 고급 설정 (Parameters)
*   **Temperature**: 창의성 조절 (높을수록 엉뚱하고 창의적, 낮을수록 논리적이고 반복적)
*   **Top P / Top K**: 답변 다양성 제어

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **노드 에디터 업데이트 예정**

`,St=`# 크리에이터 기여 보상 (Contribution Reward)

창의적인 캐릭터 제작으로 서비스 활성화에 기여하신 크리에이터분들께 감사의 의미를 담은 보상을 제공합니다. 🎁
PersonaXi는 창작자의 노력이 존중받는 건강한 생태계를 함께 만들어갑니다.

## 📈 기여도 산정 방식

제작하신 캐릭터가 사용자들과 상호작용하며 서비스 가치를 높일 때마다 기여 포인트가 누적됩니다.

* **산정 기준:** 캐릭터 상호작용 지수 및 서비스 활성 기여도 기반
* **보상 비율:** 시스템 기여도에 따라 산출된 일정 비율의 **제작자 포인트(무상)** 지급

## 🎁 보상 활용 및 정산 정책

누적된 '제작자 포인트'는 아래와 같이 서비스 내에서 창작 활동을 지속하기 위한 용도로 활용됩니다.

### 1. 제작 지원 재화(뉴런) 전환
* 누적된 기여 포인트를 서비스 이용 재화인 **뉴런(무상)**으로 전환하여, 유료 AI 모델 사용 또는 캐릭터 고도화에 재투자할 수 있습니다.
* **주의:** 기여 보상으로 전환된 뉴런은 '무상 지급 재화'로 분류되며, 구매한 '유상 뉴런'과는 엄격히 분리 관리됩니다. (무상 뉴런은 환불 및 환급 대상에서 제외됩니다.)

### 2. 파트너 정산 프로그램 (준비 중)
* 플랫폼 기여도가 높은 우수 크리에이터를 대상으로 하는 **'파트너 정산 프로그램'**을 준비 중입니다.
* 해당 프로그램은 단순 포인트 환전이 아닌, **콘텐츠 공급 계약에 따른 사업/기타소득 정산** 방식으로 운영될 예정이며, 관련 법령에 의거한 투명한 정산 절차를 준수합니다.

> [!TIP]
> **기여도를 높이는 창작 가이드**
> * 완성도 높은 페르소나와 매력적인 시각 자료로 사용자의 몰입감을 높여보세요.
> * **초기 상호작용(First 3-Turns)** 설계가 중요합니다! 흥미진진한 대화의 시작을 유도해보세요.
> * 정기적인 캐릭터 업데이트를 통해 사용자들과 지속적으로 소통하세요.`,Mt=`# 로어북(Lorebook) 시스템 가이드

## 로어북이란?

로어북(Lorebook), 또는 **World Info**는 AI 캐릭터가 기억해야 할 방대한 세계관, 인물, 장소, 사건 등의 정보를 담아두는 "지식 저장소"입니다.

AI는 모든 것을 한 번에 기억할 수 없습니다(기억 용량 제한). 로어북은 대화 중에 관련된 키워드가 나오면, **그 순간에 필요한 정보만** 똑똑하게 꺼내어 AI에게 전달합니다.

---

## 핵심 기능

### 1. 키워드 감지 (Keywords)
대화 속에 특정 단어가 등장하면 정보가 활성화됩니다.
*   **예시**: 키워드 \`["엘프", "요정", "숲의 종족"]\` 중 하나라도 언급되면 **'엘프'**에 대한 설정이 AI에게 주입됩니다.
*   여러 개의 단어를 쉼표(,)로 구분하여 등록할 수 있습니다.

### 2. 우선순위 (Priority)
한 번에 너무 많은 정보가 활성화되면, 가장 중요한 정보부터 선택됩니다.
*   **높음 (100~)**: 절대 잊으면 안 되는 핵심 설정
*   **중간 (50)**: 일반적인 정보
*   **낮음 (10)**: 알면 좋지만 몰라도 되는 잡지식

### 3. 무제한 저장소 (Unlimited Entries)
로어북에 등록할 수 있는 항목의 개수에는 **제한이 없습니다**. 수백, 수천 개의 설정을 마음껏 추가하세요. 단, 한 번의 대화에 가져오는 정보량은 조절됩니다.

---

## 작성 규칙 & 팁

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **토큰 절약을 위한 제한**
> 
> *   **항목당 길이 제한**: 최대 **500자**
> *   **동시 활성화 제한**: 약 **2000 토큰** (가장 중요한 정보 순으로 채워집니다)

### 작성 팁

1.  **간결하게 작성하세요**: AI는 장황한 설명보다 핵심 요약을 더 잘 이해합니다.
2.  **키워드는 신중하게**: 너무 흔한 단어(예: "나", "그것")를 등록하면 정보가 불필요하게 자주 활성화되어 기억 용량을 낭비합니다.
3.  **명확한 관계 정의**: 인물 관계나 사건의 인과 관계를 명확히 서술하면 일관성 있는 대화가 가능해집니다.

---

## 예시

### [장소] 잊혀진 신전
*   **키워드**: \`잊혀진 신전\`, \`고대 유적\`, \`북쪽 숲\`
*   **우선순위**: 50
*   **내용**:
    > 북쪽 숲 깊은 곳에 위치한 고대 엘프들의 신전. 지금은 폐허가 되어 몬스터들의 소굴이 되었다. 전설에 따르면 신전 지하에는 '세계수의 씨앗'이 잠들어 있다고 한다.

### [아이템] 엑스칼리버
*   **키워드**: \`엑스칼리버\`, \`성검\`, \`약속된 승리의 검\`
*   **우선순위**: 90
*   **내용**:
    > 호수의 여인이 준 전설의 성검. 선택받은 자만이 뽑을 수 있으며, 소유자는 전투에서 절대 패배하지 않는 가호를 받는다. 현재는 행방불명 상태다.

## 콘텐츠 운영 정책 및 안전 시스템 (Content Safety)

PersonaXi는 모든 사용자가 안전하게 서비스를 이용할 수 있도록 체계적인 콘텐츠 관리 시스템을 운영하고 있습니다.

* **콘텐츠 가드레일(Safety Guardrails) 적용:** AI가 생성하는 모든 결과물은 당사의 내부 윤리 가이드라인에 따라 필터링되며, 비속어, 혐오 표현, 위험 콘텐츠 등에 대해 실시간 모니터링 및 제한 조치가 취해집니다.
* **표현 수위의 단계적 관리:** 서비스 내 모든 콘텐츠는 보편적인 이용 기준에 맞춰 관리됩니다. 묘사 수위가 당사의 운영 정책을 초과할 우려가 있는 경우, 시스템에 의해 해당 콘텐츠의 노출이 제한되거나 조정될 수 있습니다.
* **시각 자료의 보편성 유지:** 모든 캐릭터의 대표 이미지(썸네일)는 공공장소에서도 열람 가능한 수준으로 유지되어야 합니다. 기준에 부합하지 않는 이미지는 시스템에 의해 **자동 블러(Blur) 처리** 또는 노출 차단 조치가 즉시 시행됩니다.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **창작자 준수 사항**
> 모든 사용자 생성 콘텐츠(UGC)에 대한 법적 책임은 제작자에게 귀속됩니다. 당사는 아동 보호, 저작권 준수, 반사회적 콘텐츠 금지 등 관련 법령을 엄격히 준수하며, 위반 시 사전 경고 없이 콘텐츠 삭제 및 이용 제한 조치를 취할 수 있습니다.`,Lt=`# 버추얼 모델 업로드 가이드

## 📖 스토리 채팅 (Story / Simulation Chat)
**"내가 주인공이 되는 인터랙티브 소설"**

단순한 대화를 넘어, 상황(Situation)을 시뮬레이션하거나 여러 캐릭터가 등장하는 이야기를 전개합니다.
*   **특징**: 텍스트 어드벤처, 롤플레잉 게임(RPG), 시뮬레이션
